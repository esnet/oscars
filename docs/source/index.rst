OSCARS 1.0
==========

The **O**\ n-demand **S**\ ecure **C**\ ircuits and **A**\ dvance **R**\ eservation **S**\ ystem, OSCARS, is a freely available open-source product. As developed by the Department of Energyâ€™s high-performance science network ESnet, OSCARS was designed by network engineers who specialize in supporting the U.S. national laboratory system and its data-intensive collaborations.

OSCARS is an advanced software system for booking time and resources on high-speed science networks, which are used by large teams of researchers to share vast amounts of data. Compared with "commodity" networks, science networks must transport stunning amounts of data both quickly and flawlessly. It can take weeks or months to manually configure a network to support large scientific collaborations involving supercomputers, advanced instruments, and scientists distributed around the world. OSCARS deftly cuts through this complexity and can configure and reserve a reliable, customized set of network connections in a matter of minutes, not weeks.

In addition to science applications, OSCARS provides network operators the ability to dynamically provision backup resources should their network experience unforeseen outages.

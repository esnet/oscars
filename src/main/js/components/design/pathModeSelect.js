                                <p>In this mode OSCARS will calculate the shortest path (based on policy
                                    metric) that will fit the bandwidth you want. You will always be able
                                    to find a zero-bandwidth path. This is the recommended mode to use for
                                    most connections.</p>

                                <p>This mode will re-calculate the path every time you change the bandwidth,
                                    as well as when you make changes to the ERO.
                                    Depending on your input and the state of the network, a path might not be
                                    found; in that case you won't be able to lock the pipe. </p>

                                    If you change the bandwidth, the path will not change as it does in 'Fits' mode;
                                    instead, your input will be validated against previously calculated
                                    maximum values. If it exceeds those values, you won't be able to lock the pipe.</p>

                                    in both directions.
                                    Use when you want the most possible bandwidth over the network with less regard

## topo

Topology-related scripts and utilities; currently mostly ESnet-specific Python code that work with Python 2.x

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Installs the required packages

`esdb_topo.py`
- Pokes ESDB and generates
  * `output/devices.json`
  * `output.adjacencies.json`1ยก
- These files are used within `backend/config/topo` in `esnet-devices.json` and `esnet-adjcies.json` respectively

`wget -4 https://graphite.es.net/api/west/snmp/?interface_descr= > input/graphite_ports.json`
 - Generates additional port information from SNMP 
  
`improve_esdb_topo.py` : 
 - Reads: `output/devices.json`, `input/graphite_ports.json`
 - STDOUT, redirect to generate an improved `devices.json` file

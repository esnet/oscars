## Synopsis
Short for "On-demand Secure Circuits and Advance Reservation System," OSCARS is 
a freely available open-source product. As developed by the Department of 
Energyâ€™s high-performance science network ESnet, OSCARS was designed by 
network engineers who specialize in supporting the U.S. national laboratory 
system and its data-intensive collaborations. 

This project is a complete redesign of the original OSCARS to improve performance and maintainability.
